data analysis and machine learning

This is a collection of smal machine projects that I worked on. I will update this repository overtime. 
- Project 1: Helping Ecommerce company to determine whether to increase their efforts on Mobile app vs Website app to increase customer retention. Used Linear Regression to train dataset
- Project 2: working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
